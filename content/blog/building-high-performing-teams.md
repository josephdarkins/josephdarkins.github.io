# Building and Leading High-Performing Engineering Teams

I've had the privilege of building engineering teams across very different organizations—from the early days at startups to scaling teams across global Fortune 500 companies. Here's what I've learned about what actually makes teams perform at their best.

## The First Hire Problem

Building a team starts before you hire the first engineer. It starts with clarity:

- What problem are you solving?
- What kind of culture do you want to create?
- What does success look like in year one?

I learned this the hard way. My first hiring decisions set the tone for everything that came after. One great hire at the beginning can shape the culture in ways that hundreds of subsequent hires simply can't.

## Scaling Without Losing Your Soul

The hardest transition is from 5 people to 15. At 5 people, everything is obvious. At 15, you need systems. But add the wrong systems too early and you kill the entrepreneurial spirit that made the team great.

The key is intentionality. When you hit 5 people, invest in:

- **Clear communication channels**. Who decides what? How do decisions get made?
- **Documented practices**. Not policies, but how things actually work
- **Regular feedback**. More formal 1-on-1s and team retrospectives
- **Explicit values**. What do we believe? What are our non-negotiables?

## The Challenge of Global Teams

I've managed teams across EMEA, USA, and APAC. The time zones are hard, but that's not the real challenge.

The real challenge is ensuring that:

- People across regions feel connected to a common mission
- You can still move fast despite distributed decision-making
- Remote doesn't mean disconnected
- You're not accidentally creating a hierarchy based on proximity

What worked for me:

- **Async communication as a default**. Document decisions. Make announcements in writing first.
- **Synchronous connection intentionally**. Regular all-hands, smaller group sessions, occasional in-person time
- **Local autonomy, global alignment**. Trust regional leaders. Align on strategy.

## Hiring and Culture

Your team culture is determined by who you hire. Not the ping-pong table or the free snacks—by the people you bring in.

I've become very intentional about hiring for three things:

1. **Capability**. Can they do the job? Do they have the skills?
2. **Learning orientation**. Do they want to grow? Can they learn new things?
3. **How they treat people**. Are they kind? Do they make others better?

The third one is harder to assess but infinitely more important. One toxic person can destroy team morale in ways that one brilliant jerks just can't overcome.

## Retaining Great People

Low attrition doesn't mean you're doing everything right. Sometimes losing people is healthy. But retaining your best people requires:

- **Growth opportunities**. Clear paths to more responsibility
- **Autonomy**. Trust them to do their work
- **Regular conversations about the future**. Don't wait for them to come to you with a resignation
- **Competitive compensation**. You can't attract or retain great people on the cheap
- **Meaningful work**. People want to know their work matters

## The One Metric That Matters

If you only track one thing, track whether your engineers would recommend their job to their friends. That single question tells you almost everything about team health.

## Lessons Learned

The teams I'm most proud of weren't the ones that shipped the most features. They were the ones that:

- Grew stronger over time, not just bigger
- Maintained high standards while moving fast
- Attracted great people who wanted to work together
- Made decisions that prioritized long-term sustainability over short-term metrics
- Had fun doing it

Building great teams is hard. But it's the most leverage you have as a leader. One great team can outperform five mediocre ones.

What have you learned about building great teams? I'd love to hear your experience.
