# Product Strategy in Uncertain Times

I've led product teams through economic uncertainty, rapid market shifts, and fundamental changes in customer behavior. The best lesson I've learned is this: clarity in uncertain times is your biggest competitive advantage.

## The Problem with Traditional Product Roadmaps

When everything is changing, detailed 18-month roadmaps become fiction. They give you the feeling of control without the reality.

I learned this while managing product during significant business transitions. We'd plan carefully. The market would shift. Our assumptions would break. We'd be stuck defending a plan nobody believed in.

## A Better Framework

Instead, I use a framework based on three layers:

### Layer 1: The Thesis (2-3 Year Horizon)

What do you believe about your customers and the market? What problem are you solving? This should be relatively stable.

For example, at RateSetter: "Investors will increasingly want control over where their capital goes and direct access to returns."

This thesis lasted years and guided many product decisions.

### Layer 2: Bets (6-12 Month Horizon)

What are the key things you need to prove or improve to validate your thesis? These are your bets.

At RateSetter: We bet that creating an IFISA would attract institutional capital. We bet that transparency would drive customer loyalty.

These bets guided what we built and what we measured.

### Layer 3: Delivery (1-3 Month Horizon)

What are we shipping next? This is detailed and specific. But it's only detailed at the level you need for execution.

## Maintaining Clarity While Moving

The real work is keeping these layers connected:

1. **Your thesis should inform your bets**. If a bet doesn't support your thesis, it shouldn't be a bet.
2. **Your bets should guide your delivery**. If shipping something doesn't move one of your bets forward, ask why you're doing it.
3. **Results should update your thinking**. When a bet fails, you update your thesis or develop a new bet.

## Dealing with Pressure

The hardest moments come when someone above you wants a feature or initiative that doesn't fit your strategy. This happens constantly.

My approach:

1. **Understand their underlying need**. They're not wrong to want something. But what are they actually trying to solve?
2. **Show how your strategy addresses it**. Usually, your strategy actually does address their concern, just differently.
3. **Make a call**. If it's genuinely outside your strategy, say so. Either your strategy changes or you commit to not doing it.
4. **Measure and learn**. If you do change direction, measure what happens. Did it work?

## The Role of Data

Data is important. But it's not your only input.

I've seen teams obsess over metrics that moved the wrong direction. I've also seen teams ignore data that contradicted their assumptions.

The best teams use data to:

- Validate assumptions before committing significant resources
- Understand customer behavior in the wild
- Catch unexpected consequences
- Find areas where intuition is wrong

But they don't let data make strategy. Data informs strategy. People make strategy.

## When to Change Direction

This is the hard one. How do you know when to stick with your strategy versus pivot?

My rule:

- If you're early in your bets, you need more data
- If you've proven your bets work but the market has fundamentally changed, you pivot
- If you're achieving your bets but they're not driving overall success, you revisit your thesis

Don't change direction too fast. But don't stick with something that's clearly broken just because you committed to it.

## Looking Forward

The companies doing best right now aren't the ones with the most detailed plans. They're the ones that:

- Have a clear thesis
- Make explicit bets
- Measure what matters
- Update their thinking based on reality
- Move decisively while staying connected to their strategy

That's how you maintain clarity in uncertain times.

What's your framework for thinking about product strategy? I'd love to hear how you approach this.
